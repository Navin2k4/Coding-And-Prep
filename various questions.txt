1. Given a String with numbers and operators. Perform the operations on the numbers in their respective order. 
Input : "12345*+-+"
Output: 6
Explanation: [1*2+3-4+5 = 6] 

2. Program to check whether the given matrix is an upper triangular or lower triangular.
The constraint was each element should be visited only once. 

** Learn how to iterate the upper triangle and the lower triangle we used this approach in the word search might be useful to implement
 Input:
 4 6 1 4
 0 3 5 9
 0 0 6 2
 0 0 0 8
 
 Output: Upper Triangular Matrix 
 
 Input:
 1 0 
 1 1
 Output: Lower Triangular Matrix

 3. Find the longest increasing sub-sequence in Array.
Input : {1,5,3,7}
Output: {1,5,7} or {1,3,7}

Input : {10,22,9,33,21,50,41}
Output: {10,22,33,50}


4. Given an array nums containing n distinct numbers in the range [0, n], return the only number in the range that is missing from the array.
5. Given a string column title that represents the column title as appears in an Excel sheet, return its corresponding column number.
6. There were two strings given and you have to modify the second string according to some rules in comparison to the first string.

7. Check whether a string is a subsequence of another or not.
8. Letter combination of a phone number. Given a string containing digits 0-9, return all possible letter combinations. Letter combination of a phone number.
9. It was a stack question. It was similar to Decode a string recursively encoded as count followed by substring.
