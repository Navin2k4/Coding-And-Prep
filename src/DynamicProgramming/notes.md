# How to find weather the problem is a DP

- Count the total number of ways
- minimum output
- maximum output

-> we apply recursion

Try all possible ways -> count / best ways
- we will apply Recursion to find all possible ways

## How to approach DP
1. Try to represent the problem in terms of index
2. Do all possible stufs on that index according to the problem statement
3. If the question says count all the ways -> sum up al stufs
   If the question says find min/max -> take the min/max


# DP on Strings
-  comparision
-  replace/ edit
