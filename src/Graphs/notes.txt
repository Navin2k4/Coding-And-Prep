two types of graphs
- Directed
- Undirected

Terms 
Nodes
Edges
Degree

Representations
Adj. Matrix
Adj. List

Connected Components
Components -> Different graphs seperately

Traversal
Always we use a visited array



BFS -> Level order traversal -> Queue and Visited implementation
DFS -> Depth Order traversal -> Stack and Visited implementation and Recursive approach 
    -> we can use the explicit stack if we dont want a recursive approach in whic it will use the recursive stack
